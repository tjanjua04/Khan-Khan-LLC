Project Information and details:

a. In this program, we are matching physicians to countries based on their language fluency and specialization.

b. The solutions implemented in our program are to use doubles instead of int type values when estimating the probability

c. We calculated the probability of a physician matching with a specific country by calculating 1/(the number of possibilities). The number of
possibilities is calculated by multiplying the number of languages by the number of countries. We use a random number generator to generate a random 
number between 0 and 9, and we plug this number into the second dimension of the array to select a random country to match to the user. We also use 
switch statements to 

d. The program's objective is to match a physician to a specific region based on the language they are fluent in and their medical specialization. The 
program will ask the user to enter their language fluency and specialization, and the program will match the user to a country accordingly.

e. Discrete structures are implemented into the program by use of probability, switch statements, and arrays

f. One of the limitations of this program is that if the user enters a number that is not 1-5 for the language fluency question, the program will display
an error message, but it will not make the user enter a valid answer. Another limitation is that when the program asks the user to pick a 
specialization, if the user does not enter 1-5, the code will continue to run.

g. A great recommendation on improving the limitations of the program is to write a do while loop for all choices and have the while be if the user does 
not pick the correct number.
