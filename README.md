CIS-7: Discrete Structures

Professor: Dr. Kasey Nguyen

Date Published: 6/7/23

Summary of our project:

Our project uses discrete structures to help a user decide where to place a physician based on the language that they're fluent with and the
specialization that they practice.

What we learned:

We learned how to utilize discrete structures using probability, arrays, and other implimentations to efficiently run our code.

How to use program:

User enters the language they are most fluent in, then the user enters what specilization they practice, based off of this the program will predict 
what area is best suited for the user based on the input.
