CIS-7: Discrete Structures

Professor: Dr. Kasey Nguyen

Date Published: 6/7/23

Summary of our project:

Our project uses discrete structures to help a user decide where to place a physician based on the language that they're fluent with and thespecialization that they practice. After placing a physician in an area where they would specialize, the code outputs the probability and the sample size.

What we learned:

We learned how to utilize discrete structures using probability, arrays, and other implimentations to efficiently run our code. We also learned how to better utilize psudeocode and explain our code in a sense that anyone could pick up where we left off.

How to use program:

User enters the language they are most fluent in, then the user enters what specilization they practice, based off of this the program will predict what area is best suited for the user based on the input and probability of getting that output.
