CIS-7: Discrete Structures

Professor: Dr. Kasey Nguyen

Summary of our project:

Our project uses discrete structures to help a user decide where to place a physician based on the language that they're fluent with and the
specialization that they practice

What we learned:

We learned how to utilize discrete structures using probability, arrays, and other implimentations to efficiently run our code.
